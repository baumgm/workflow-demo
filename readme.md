# GitHub Basics

The project is used to show the basics for using workflows in github.

## Exercise

- Create a new repository on github or github enterprise
- create a dummy quarkus project (or other project you want) and commit it in github
- create a pipeline to build the service on push on main (this could be a deploy pipeline)
- create a separate pipeline only for pull request (this could be the build pipeline)
- define a secret and use it in the workflow
